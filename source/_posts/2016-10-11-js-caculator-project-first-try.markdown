This is my first attempted on freecodecamp advanced project js online calculator.[ Link](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/rLJZrA/)

Here are the User stories:

1. User Story: I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.(complete)

1. User Story: I can clear the input field with a clear button.
(complete)

1. User Story: I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.(failed)

###Other checklists:

* can't enter 0 twice (done)

* if enter ".", the screen appears "0." (done)

* if enter "AC", activate all clear function (done)

* if enter "CE", only clear current entry (done)

* can't enter operators twice(failed)

### Reasons why my approach failed

1. My algorithm only works on one calculation but doesn't work with chaining calculation. Because my memory variable only store one variable. I plan on switching to using an array.

2. For preventing enter operator twice, I'm still thinking on how to prevent this.

Besides the two bugs, the html, css of the calculator looks good and is functional. Here's is the link for my current project. I'll post another post after I figure out how to deal with the remaining two bugs.[ Codepen JS calculator link](http://codepen.io/dannyhuang/pen/ozdzLm)
